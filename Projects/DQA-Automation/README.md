# Data Quality Assurance (DQA) Automation Project: Enhancing Data Integrity Across EDARP‚Äôs 14 Facilities  

*Automating data validation, cleaning, and performance monitoring to improve accuracy, accountability, and efficiency across EDARP‚Äôs health programs.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **Data Quality Assurance (DQA) Automation Project** was developed to **streamline and automate** data validation and quality checks across **Eastern Deanery AIDS Relief Program (EDARP)** facilities.  

Previously, DQA relied on **manual Excel-based reviews**, which were time-consuming, inconsistent, and error-prone. This project replaced those processes with a fully automated framework built using **SQL Server**, **Python**, and **Power BI**, enabling real-time detection of missing data, inconsistencies, and indicator mismatches across HIV/TB, MCH, and OPD programs.  

As the **System Architect and M&E/ICT Lead**, I designed the full automation pipeline ‚Äî from rule definition to visualization ‚Äî ensuring compliance with **PEPFAR‚Äôs MER guidance**, **Kenya MOH standards**, and institutional data governance protocols.

## üéØ Core Objectives
- Automate data validation and indicator verification across all 14 EDARP facilities  
- Reduce manual workload and human error in DQA reviews  
- Provide management with **real-time visibility** of data completeness and consistency  
- Strengthen accountability and continuous improvement through system-driven feedback loops

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Rule Definition & Mapping  
Developed a comprehensive **DQA Validation Rule Matrix** covering completeness, timeliness, consistency, and uniqueness.  
Mapped rules to specific indicators (e.g., validating `TX_CURR` vs. `TX_NEW + TX_RTT`).

### 2. Automation Script Design  
Built **Python and SQL scripts** to auto-flag outliers, missing data, and logical inconsistencies.  
Configured **SQL Server Agent jobs** for nightly execution and automated refreshes.

### 3. Error Logging & Tracking  
Created a **dynamic Error Log Table** capturing facility, variable, anomaly type, and resolution status.  
Added **timestamped audit trails** for full accountability.

### 4. Dashboard Development  
Designed **Power BI dashboards** with color-coded visualizations showing:  
- Error trends by facility  
- Data completeness and timeliness  
- Indicator accuracy (EMR vs DHIS2)  
- DQA audit completion and status tracking  
Automated **email summaries** delivered weekly to facility teams.

### 5. Feedback & Correction Loop  
Facility M&E teams received **automated DQA reports**, implemented corrections, and synced data for re-validation.  
Resolved issues were automatically logged as ‚Äúclosed‚Äù within the audit trail.

### 6. Capacity Building  
Trained **22 data officers** and M&E staff on dashboard interpretation, troubleshooting, and maintenance of validation scripts.

## üìà Results & Impact
| Outcome | Result |
|----------|---------|
| **Data Accuracy** | Reporting discrepancies reduced by **71%** across 14 facilities |
| **Timeliness** | DQA cycle time reduced from **5 days ‚Üí 6 hours** |
| **Efficiency** | Saved approximately **160 staff hours per month** |
| **Accountability** | Introduced **audit trail logs** with user-level tracking |
| **Reliability** | Achieved **98% alignment** with DHIS2 quarterly data |

## üí° Lessons Learned & Future Improvements
- **Challenge:** Initial validation rules generated false positives due to strict thresholds  
- **Improvement:** Introduced **adaptive thresholds** and dynamic indicator ranges  
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Implement **machine learning models** to predict facilities likely to generate errors  
  - Add **chatbot notifications** (via Teams/WhatsApp) for instant anomaly alerts  
  - Expand DQA automation to include **finance and HR datasets** for full institutional oversight
