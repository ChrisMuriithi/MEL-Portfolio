# LINDA PIA DADA Mobile App: Digital HIV Prevention for AGYW in Nairobi  

*Empowering Adolescent Girls and Young Women (AGYW) with digital access to HIV prevention, SRH education, and real-time linkage to care.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **LINDA PIA DADA Mobile App Project** was developed under EDARP‚Äôs **LINDA PIA DADA Initiative**, funded by the **ViiV Healthcare Positive Action Programme**.  

This project introduced a **dual digital access system**‚Äîa mobile app that enables AGYW to access **sexual and reproductive health (SRH)** information, book appointments, and link to HIV prevention and post-violence care services seamlessly.  

As the **System Design and M&E/ICT Lead**, I directed the **technical design**, **MEL integration**, and **analytics architecture**, ensuring interoperability with the **Ecare EMR** and full compliance with **Kenya‚Äôs Data Protection Act (2019)**.

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Needs Assessment & Co-Design  
Conducted **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** sessions with AGYW and peer educators.  
Mapped user journeys covering education, booking, and feedback flows while prioritizing privacy and accessibility.  

### 2. Mobile App Development  
Developed the **LINDA PIA DADA Android App (v1.0)** using **Flutter/Dart** with offline mode support.  
Included modules for:  
- HIV prevention education & myth busting  
- Facility locator and PrEP appointment booking  
- Anonymous feedback & post-violence care support  

### 3. Integration with EMR  
Linked the app with **Ecare EMR** via **RESTful APIs**, allowing automated appointment creation, referral tracking, and follow-up scheduling.  

### 4. Data Flow & MEL Integration  
Established a pipeline from **mobile ‚Üí API ‚Üí SQL Server ‚Üí Power BI**.  
Configured **DAX measures** to track: engagement rate, appointment completion, and drop-off points from awareness to initiation.  

### 5. Dashboards & Analytics  
Developed a **real-time Power BI dashboard** featuring:  
- Unique AGYW users by ward  
- PrEP uptake and referral conversion  
- Most-accessed app modules and peak usage hours  
- Geo-heatmaps of digital demand and service linkages  

### 6. Testing & Deployment  
Piloted across **Kayole**, **Soweto**, **Kariobangi**, and **Donholm** communities.  
Collected user feedback to refine UI/UX and optimize performance.  

### 7. Data Protection & Security  
Implemented two-tier consent, encrypted identifiers, and anonymized analytics.  
Ensured compliance with **Kenya DPA (2019)** principles of purpose limitation and data minimization.
