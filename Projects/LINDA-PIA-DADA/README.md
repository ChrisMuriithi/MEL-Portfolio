## üß© Project Overview
**LINDA PIA DADA** (*Swahili for ‚ÄúProtect My Sister‚Äù*) is a two-year, **ViiV Healthcare‚Äìfunded** project implemented by **Eastern Deanery AIDS Relief Program (EDARP)**.  

It aims to enhance HIV prevention, care, and treatment outcomes among **Adolescent Girls and Young Women (AGYW)** in Nairobi‚Äôs eastern slums through **digital health transformation**, **community empowerment**, and **data analytics**.

As the **M&E and ICT Lead**, I designed the project‚Äôs digital monitoring and analytics framework ‚Äî integrating EMR, mobile tools, and real-time dashboards while ensuring compliance with **Kenya‚Äôs Data Protection Act (2019)**.

## üéØ Key Goals
- Increase demand for ARV-based HIV prevention (**PrEP/PEP**) services  
- Strengthen linkage and retention to care among AGYW  
- Improve data visibility using **mobile & EMR-based** reporting systems  
- Enhance community engagement through **digital and peer-led** interventions

## üß∞ Languages & Utilities Used
| Tool / Language | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|
| **SQL Server** | Structured data storage, cleaning, and indicator analysis |
| **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** | Data validation, visualization, and report automation |
| **Power BI** | Real-time dashboards (PrEP uptake, outreach coverage, adherence trends) |
| **Excel / Power Query** | Routine monitoring and indicator tracking, validation checks |
| **KoboToolbox** | Mobile data collection by Community Health Promoters |
| **NVivo** | Qualitative coding and thematic analysis |
| **Ecare EMR** | Integrated clinical data and HIV care continuity |

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment / Platforms
- **SQL Server** (on-premise) for facility-level data management  
- **Power BI Service** for dashboard publication and stakeholder access  
- **KoboCollect Android App** for real-time field data entry  
- **NVivo 14** desktop for qualitative analysis  
- **Integration Layer:** APIs connecting Ecare EMR with community data (CSV/JSON exports)  

---

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Needs Assessment
Conducted a rapid data gap analysis across **14 facilities** to identify weaknesses in appointment adherence, PrEP linkage, and follow-up documentation.

### 2. Tool Design & Alignment
Developed data collection tools aligned with **ViiV** and **PEPFAR MER 2.8.2** indicators, integrating modules for outreach, digital engagement, and follow-up.

### 3. Data Pipeline Setup
Built an **SQL-based integration** pulling data from **Ecare EMR**, **KoboToolbox**, and **pharmacy logs**, with scheduled **ETL jobs** to clean and merge data weekly.

### 4. Dashboard Development
Created **Power BI dashboards** displaying AGYW reach, PrEP_NEW, adherence, and peer educator performance with **DAX-based** metrics for adherence and walk-ins.

### 5. Reporting & Learning
Automated generation of quarterly **Learning Briefs** and **visual summaries** used in review meetings and stakeholder feedback sessions.

### 6. Data Protection Integration
Embedded **informed consent** and **privacy protocols** across all digital tools, ensuring full compliance with **Kenya‚Äôs DPA 2019**.
