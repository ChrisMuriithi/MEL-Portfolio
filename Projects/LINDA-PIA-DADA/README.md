# LINDA PIA DADA: Strengthening Digital HIV Prevention for AGYW in Nairobi

## 1. Description
**LINDA PIA DADA** (Swahili for *“Protect My Sister”*) is a two-year, **ViiV Healthcare–funded** project implemented by **Eastern Deanery AIDS Relief Program (EDARP)**.  
It focuses on improving HIV prevention, care, and treatment outcomes among **Adolescent Girls and Young Women (AGYW)** in the eastern slums of Nairobi through **digital innovation**, **community empowerment**, and **data-driven decision-making**.

As the **M&E and ICT Lead**, I spearheaded the design, monitoring, and analytics architecture for the project.  
This included integrating digital tools for real-time reporting, automating dashboards, and ensuring compliance with the **Data Protection Act (2019)**.

### Project Goals
- Increase demand for ARV-based HIV prevention (PrEP/PEP) services  
- Strengthen linkage and retention to care among AGYW  
- Improve data visibility and reporting using mobile and EMR-based systems  
- Enhance community engagement through digital and peer-led interventions

## 2. Languages and Utilities Used
- **SQL Server** – Structured data storage, cleaning, and indicator analysis  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – Data validation, visualization, and automation of reporting pipelines  
- **Power BI** – Real-time dashboards on outreach, PrEP uptake, and appointment adherence  
- **Excel / Power Query** – Routine monitoring, indicator tracking, and validation checks  
- **KoboToolbox** – Mobile data collection by Community Health Promoters  
- **NVivo** – Qualitative data coding and thematic analysis  
- **Ecare EMR** – Integrated clinical data on AGYW and HIV care continuity

## 3. Environment / Platforms Used
- On-premise **SQL Server 2019** for facility-level data management  
- **Power BI Service** for dashboard publication and stakeholder access  
- **KoboCollect Android App** for real-time data entry and monitoring  
- **NVivo 14** desktop environment for coding and qualitative analysis  
- **Integration Layer:** APIs connecting Ecare EMR with community-based data (CSV/JSON exports)

## 4. Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Needs Assessment
Conducted a rapid data gap assessment across 14 facilities and community points to identify weaknesses in appointment adherence, PrEP linkage, and follow-up documentation.

### 2. Tool Design & Alignment
Developed data collection tools aligned with **ViiV** and **PEPFAR MER 2.8.2** indicators, covering community outreach, digital engagement, and clinical follow-up modules.

### 3. Data Pipeline Setup
Built an **SQL-based integration** pulling data from **Ecare EMR**, **KoboToolbox**, and **pharmacy logs**, with scheduled ETL jobs to clean and merge datasets weekly.

### 4. Dashboard Development
Designed **Power BI dashboards** showing AGYW reach, PrEP_NEW, adherence trends, and peer educator performance.  
Added **DAX measures** for appointment adherence and walk-in rates.

### 5. Reporting & Learning
Automated generation of quarterly learning briefs and visual summaries used in project review meetings.

### 6. Data Protection Integration
Embedded consent and privacy checks in all tools to ensure compliance with **Kenya’s DPA 2019**.
