# **LINDA PIA DADA: Strengthening Digital HIV Prevention for AGYW in Nairobi**

## 1. Description
**LINDA PIA DADA** (Swahili: “Protect My Sister”) is a two‑year ViiV Positive Action–funded project at **EDARP** to improve HIV prevention, care, and treatment outcomes among **AGYW** through digital innovation and data‑driven decision‑making. As **M&E and ICT Lead**, I designed the data architecture, real‑time reporting, and DPA‑compliant workflows.
**Goals:** increase PrEP/PEP demand, strengthen linkage & retention, improve data visibility via mobile/EMR systems, and deepen community engagement via peer‑led interventions.

## 2. Languages and Utilities Used
SQL Server; Python (Pandas, Matplotlib); Power BI; Excel/Power Query; KoboToolbox; NVivo; **Ecare EMR**.

## 3. Environment / Platforms Used
On‑prem SQL Server 2019; Power BI Service; KoboCollect Android; NVivo 14; Ecare EMR with CSV/JSON integration layer.

## 4. Step-by-Step Walkthrough
Needs assessment across 14 facilities → tool design aligned to MER 2.8.2 → SQL-based data pipeline (EMR + Kobo + pharmacy) with weekly ETL → Power BI dashboards (AGYW reach, PrEP_NEW, adherence) → automated learning briefs → embedded consent & privacy checks (DPA 2019).

## 5. Key Outputs / Deliverables
M&E plan; real‑time dashboards; SQL cleaning scripts; DQA tools; learning briefs & infographics.

## 6. Results and Impact
PrEP uptake hit 78% of annual targets in 9 months; no‑shows reduced by 32%; 42 staff + 28 CHPs trained; dashboards adopted for micro‑planning.

## 7. Lessons Learned / Future Improvements
API sync needed ongoing tuning; next: ML drop‑off prediction; DHIS2 integration for sustainability.
