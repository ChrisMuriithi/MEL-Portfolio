# UPI Framework Implementation Project: Advancing Client Registry and Interoperability at EDARP  

*Digitally transforming patient identity management through a unified, verifiable, and interoperable client registry system aligned with Kenya‚Äôs national health digital strategy.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **Unique Patient Identifier (UPI) Framework Implementation Project** was launched by **Eastern Deanery AIDS Relief Program (EDARP)** to align with the **Kenya Health Act (2017)** and the **Ministry of Health‚Äôs UPI Technical Framework**.  

The initiative established a **client registry** that ensures each patient has a **single, verifiable, and interoperable identifier** across EDARP‚Äôs 14 facilities. It enhances **data accuracy**, **continuity of care**, and **interoperability** between EDARP‚Äôs **Ecare EMR**, community data systems, and national digital health platforms such as **DHIS2**, **NiShauri**, and **Ushauri**.

As the **Project Lead and M&E/ICT Manager**, I led the system design, data mapping, and **API-based integration** of facility EMRs with external registries, embedding strong **data protection and consent management workflows** throughout.

## üéØ Core Objectives
- Operationalize a **nationally compliant UPI generation and verification framework**  
- Enable **data exchange** between EDARP‚Äôs EMR and national health information systems  
- Reduce **duplicate records** and improve client tracking and data quality  
- Embed **data protection**, audit trails, and **informed consent processes** into EMR workflows

## üß∞ Languages & Utilities Used
| Tool / Platform | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|
| **SQL Server** | Core client registry, record linkage, and data validation |
| **Python** | Record deduplication and matching using Levenshtein and fuzzy logic |
| **RESTful APIs (JSON)** | Data exchange between EMR, NiShauri, and Ushauri |
| **Postman** | API testing, endpoint documentation, and sandbox validation |
| **Excel / Power Query** | UPI validation checks and interim data reconciliation |
| **NVivo** | Qualitative analysis of pilot testing feedback from facilities |
| **Power BI** | Dashboards visualizing UPI coverage, verification, and duplicates resolved |

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment / Platforms Used
- **Ecare EMR** with integrated UPI registry module  
- **Microsoft SQL Server** for backend database operations and stored procedures  
- **MoH UPI API Sandbox (FHIR-compliant)** for interoperability testing  
- **Power BI Service** for live tracking of verification and deduplication metrics  
- **Secure Cloud Backup** with nightly encrypted synchronization

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Requirement Analysis  
Conducted system audits across **14 EDARP clinics** to identify duplicate patient records and identification gaps.  
Reviewed **Kenya‚Äôs UPI Framework** to ensure compliance with national standards.

### 2. UPI Generation and Structure Design  
Adopted **National ID** and **Birth Certificate** numbers as primary data sources.  
Designed fallback logic for clients without formal IDs using community-level identifiers.

### 3. System Integration  
Developed **SQL procedures** to generate and validate UPIs automatically within EMR.  
Implemented **RESTful APIs** for real-time record verification with **NiShauri** and **Ushauri**.  
Added **consent capture** and **audit trail tracking** for full **DPA 2019** compliance.

### 4. Data Cleaning and Verification  
Used **Python scripts** for record matching (Levenshtein distance, fuzzy matching) to identify and merge duplicates.  
Created **SQL reconciliation scripts** for periodic verification and completeness checks.

### 5. Dashboard and Monitoring  
Designed a **Power BI dashboard** visualizing facility-level UPI coverage, duplicates resolved, and verification success rates.  
Enabled **automated weekly refreshes** for real-time performance tracking.

### 6. Capacity Building and Rollout  
Trained **28 data officers and facility leads** on UPI workflows, data protection, and troubleshooting.  
Piloted the system in **3 facilities** before scaling to all 14.

## üí° Lessons Learned & Future Improvements
- **Challenge:** Some clients lacked formal IDs, limiting full verification coverage.  
- **Solution:** Introduced **temporary identifiers** linked to EMR-generated UPI logic.  
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Introduce **biometric validation** for higher accuracy  
  - Apply **machine learning** for duplicate detection and anomaly scoring  
  - Integrate UPI data with **NHIF/SHIF** for universal coverage tracking
