# MEL System Strengthening & Strategic Alignment Project: Building Data-Driven Decision Ecosystems  

*Institutionalizing data use, dashboard analytics, and evidence-based decision-making across EDARP‚Äôs facilities and community platforms.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) System Strengthening & Strategic Alignment Project** was a multi-site initiative designed to build a harmonized MEL framework across all **EDARP facilities** and **community programs**.  

This project addressed fragmented donor reporting systems (PEPFAR, CDC, ViiV Positive Action) by creating a unified data architecture that enhanced real-time analytics, accountability, and adaptive learning.

As the **MEL System Lead**, I oversaw the entire process ‚Äî from **indicator harmonization** and **system integration** to **dashboard design** and **staff capacity building** ‚Äî ensuring that EDARP operated under one coordinated MEL ecosystem supporting both programmatic and strategic goals.

## üéØ Core Objectives
- Harmonize MEL indicators across **facility**, **community**, and **donor** frameworks  
- Institutionalize **data quality assurance** and **dashboard-based performance reviews**  
- Build **internal MEL capacity** for adaptive learning and continuous improvement  
- Promote **evidence-based planning** across all **14 EDARP sites**

## üß∞ Languages & Utilities Used
| Tool / Platform | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|
| **SQL Server / Excel** | Indicator mapping, dataset harmonization, validation templates |
| **Power BI** | Real-time performance dashboards across facilities |
| **NVivo** | Qualitative coding for internal learning and reflection sessions |
| **MS Teams / SharePoint** | Hosting MEL frameworks, dashboards, and collaborative documentation |

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment / Platforms
- **SQL Server (on-premise)** for structured data management  
- **Power BI Service** for organization-wide access to dashboards  
- **MS Teams / SharePoint** for version control and team collaboration  
- **Ecare EMR** integrated through periodic data exports for indicator mapping

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Indicator Harmonization  
Mapped all project indicators to donor frameworks (**PEPFAR**, **CDC**, **ViiV Positive Action**) and aligned EMR data fields with community-level tools to prevent duplication.  

### 2. System Integration  
Designed automated pipelines linking **EMR**, **Excel trackers**, and **Power BI**, embedding validation rules across domains (HTS, TX, PMTCT, TB, AGYW).

### 3. Performance Visualization  
Developed **real-time dashboards** that flagged underperforming sites and indicators, featuring **color-coded KPI tracking** and monthly review mechanisms.  

### 4. Capacity Strengthening  
Trained MEL officers and facility focal persons on dashboard interpretation, DQA tools, and logic models.  
Introduced **routine DQA templates** and **indicator reference job aids**.

### 5. Strategic Decision Support  
Institutionalized quarterly data reviews using dashboard insights, leading to faster course corrections and a **35% improvement** in timely response actions.

## üì¶ Key Outputs / Deliverables
- ‚úÖ **Unified MEL Framework** aligning indicators across donor systems  
- ‚úÖ **Power BI System Performance Dashboard** (facility & community layers)  
- ‚úÖ **DQA and Indicator Validation Toolkits**  
- ‚úÖ **Capacity-Building Package** (SOPs, logic models, indicator reference sheets)  

---

## üìà Results & Impact
| Outcome | Result |
|----------|---------|
| **Alignment** | All 14 sites operating under a single MEL logic model |
| **Timeliness** | Reduced indicator reconciliation time by **60%** |
| **Data Use** | 100% of departments using dashboards for quarterly reviews |
| **Culture Shift** | Institutionalized data-driven planning and accountability |

---

## üí° Lessons Learned & Next Steps
- **Automation Gaps:** Future iterations should integrate API-based data flow from EMR to Power BI for real-time updates.  
- **Sustainability:** Embed dashboards within **DHIS2** to strengthen institutional ownership.  
- **Scalability:** Adapt framework for replication by partner FBOs across Nairobi County.
