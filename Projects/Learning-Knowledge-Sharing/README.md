# Learning & Knowledge Sharing Project: Institutionalizing a Culture of Learning at EDARP  

*Transforming data into actionable insights through structured learning systems, AI-driven synthesis, and reflective practice.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **Learning & Knowledge Sharing Project** established a structured, organization-wide learning ecosystem within **EDARP**, linking data, reflection, and program improvement.  

This initiative institutionalized continuous learning through **scientific forums**, **After-Action Reviews (AARs)**, and **ChatGPT-powered evidence synthesis** tools ‚Äî revolutionizing how EDARP captures and applies insights from program implementation.

As the **Knowledge Management & Learning Lead**, I led the design of knowledge management systems, integrating digital collaboration tools, AI-driven research assistants, and internal feedback loops that strengthened both program design and donor engagement.

## üéØ Core Objectives
- Foster a **culture of inquiry and reflection** grounded in data  
- Transform **implementation lessons** into actionable, evidence-based knowledge  
- Integrate **AI tools** to accelerate literature synthesis and learning brief production  
- Strengthen **collaboration** between M&E, ICT, and program operations

## üß∞ Languages & Utilities Used
| Tool / Platform | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|
| **MS Teams / SharePoint** | Centralized repository for learning resources, briefs, and toolkits |
| **ChatGPT API / Python** | Automated research synthesis and AI-assisted evidence summaries |
| **PowerPoint** | Visual templates for learning briefs and presentations |
| **NVivo** | Qualitative analysis and coding of learning themes |

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment / Platforms
- **SharePoint Knowledge Portal** ‚Äì hosted learning briefs, AARs, and toolkits  
- **MS Teams** ‚Äì enabled real-time collaboration and file sharing  
- **Python + OpenAI API** ‚Äì automated evidence extraction and synthesis  
- **NVivo 14 Desktop** ‚Äì for qualitative analysis of internal reflection notes

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Learning System Design  
Developed a **‚ÄúJournal Club‚Äù** framework enabling monthly internal learning forums.  
Defined a rolling learning agenda informed by data trends, evaluation findings, and donor priorities.  

### 2. Knowledge Capture & Dissemination  
Authored and published **Learning Briefs** summarizing best practices in **AGYW**, **TB DSD**, and **HIV Prevention**.  
Developed **technical notes** used for proposal development and donor feedback sessions.

### 3. AI Integration  
Developed a **ChatGPT-powered research assistant** that automatically summarized academic papers and synthesized insights for MEL briefs.  
Reduced evidence synthesis time by **70%**, boosting learning output frequency and quality.

### 4. AARs and Pause-and-Reflect Sessions  
Introduced structured **After-Action Reviews (AARs)** using **data dashboards** to drive real-time program adjustments and adaptive learning during implementation.
