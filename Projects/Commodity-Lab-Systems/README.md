# **Commodity and Laboratory Information Systems Integration Project: Enhancing Supply Chain Visibility and Efficiency in EDARP**

## 1. Description
Integrated **PIS**, **LIMS**, and **Procurement** within Ecare to unify stock, consumption, and lab TAT data. As Integration & MEL Lead, I built architecture, linkages, dashboards, and analytics.

## 2. Languages and Utilities Used
T‑SQL; Python; Power BI; Excel/Power Query; Ecare EMR modules; Power Automate/SharePoint.

## 3. Environment / Platforms Used
Ecare EMR v4.2; SQL Server 2019; Power BI Service; SharePoint; LAN/VPN.

## 4. Step-by-Step Walkthrough
Baseline mapping → relational schema linking tests↔reagents↔stock → SQL triggers for consumption updates → procurement linkage (buffer stock/lead time) → dashboards (SOH, consumption, TAT, expiries) + email alerts → pilot, validation, scale‑up.

## 5. Key Outputs / Deliverables
Integrated schema; SQL triggers & procedures; commodity dashboards; reorder alerts; SOPs; DQA toolkit.

## 6. Results and Impact
Real‑time stock visibility; stock‑outs −52%; lab TAT 5.2→1.6 days; ~KSh 2.3M annual savings; strong auditability.

## 7. Lessons Learned / Future Improvements
Offline caching for low‑connectivity sites; next: KEMSA eLMIS API, predictive forecasting, cold‑chain & waste modules.
