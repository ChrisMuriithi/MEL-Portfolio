# Commodity and Laboratory Information Systems Integration Project: Enhancing Supply Chain Visibility and Efficiency in EDARP  

*Creating a unified digital ecosystem linking laboratory, pharmacy, and procurement systems to drive real-time visibility, efficiency, and accountability across EDARP‚Äôs health facilities.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **Commodity and Laboratory Information Systems Integration Project** unified EDARP‚Äôs **Pharmacy Information System (PIS)**, **Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)**, and **Procurement Management System** under the **Ecare EMR platform**.  

Prior to integration, commodity and laboratory data were siloed, making it difficult to track stock levels, consumption trends, and turnaround times for test results.  
The project bridged these gaps through **database linkages**, **automated analytics**, and **real-time dashboards**, providing end-to-end visibility and accountability for all commodities and laboratory operations.  

As the **System Integration and MEL Lead**, I led the architecture design, database development, and dashboard implementation ‚Äî enabling EDARP to manage stock, lab turnaround time, and procurement workflows through an integrated digital health supply chain.

## üéØ Core Objectives
- Integrate **PIS**, **LIMS**, and **Procurement modules** into a unified EMR ecosystem  
- Improve visibility of **stock status**, **consumption patterns**, and **lab turnaround times (TAT)**  
- Automate data flow for **forecasting, procurement**, and **consumption reporting**  
- Strengthen **data quality**, accountability, and transparency across all facilities

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Baseline and Systems Mapping  
Performed a comprehensive **gap analysis** of pharmacy, lab, and procurement workflows.  
Mapped data flows from **test request ‚Üí result ‚Üí commodity use ‚Üí stock update ‚Üí reorder** for full visibility.

### 2. Database Linkage Development  
Created a **relational schema** linking LIMS, PIS, and procurement datasets.  
Developed **SQL triggers** to automatically update pharmacy stock once lab reagents were consumed.

### 3. Procurement Workflow Integration  
Linked the **procurement module** with consumption data to auto-calculate reorder levels.  
Developed stored procedures computing **consumption rate**, **buffer stock**, and **lead time** dynamically.

### 4. Dashboard and Automation Setup  
Built **Power BI dashboards** visualizing:  
- Stock on Hand (SOH) by facility  
- Monthly consumption and expiry alerts  
- Lab test turnaround time (TAT)  
- Stock-out frequency and reorder levels  
Configured **email alerts** through **Power Automate** for critical stock thresholds.

### 5. Testing and Validation  
Piloted across **5 facilities** to test synchronization and data accuracy.  
Validated consumption data against **physical stock counts** and **DHIS2 logistics reports**.

### 6. Scale-Up and Training  
Trained **pharmacists, lab officers, and procurement staff** across **14 facilities**.  
Standardized data entry and approval workflows through **SOPs**, job aids, and validation checklists.
