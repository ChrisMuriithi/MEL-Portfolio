# Evaluation & Evidence Generation Project: Building Evidence for Program Impact  

*Generating actionable evidence through mixed-method evaluations, operational research, and learning-driven dissemination.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **Evaluation & Evidence Generation Project** strengthened **EDARP‚Äôs** capacity to produce actionable evidence for both internal learning and external dissemination.  
It focused on **operational research**, **post-implementation reviews**, and **evaluation of HIV/TB and AGYW** interventions to inform strategic planning and continuous program improvement.  

As a **Co-Lead Evaluator**, I designed and executed **mixed-method evaluations** integrating routine program data, **Key Informant Interviews (KIIs)**, and **Client Exit Interviews**, ensuring findings were **utilization-focused** and directly influenced program design and donor engagement.

---

## üéØ Core Objectives
- Conduct **operational research** to assess intervention feasibility and effectiveness  
- Produce **utilization-focused evaluation reports** for donor and internal planning  
- Promote **data triangulation** and evidence use for strategic decisions  
- Disseminate findings to **national and international** health forums

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Study Design  
Defined research questions aligned to priority outcomes (**TPT**, **TB DSD**, **AGYW**).  
Adopted a **mixed-method evaluation framework** integrating quantitative and qualitative data for triangulated insights.

### 2. Data Collection & Analysis  
Merged **EMR routine data**, **KIIs**, and **client feedback surveys** to form comprehensive evidence sets.  
Applied descriptive and inferential statistics in **STATA / SPSS** to measure outcome significance.

### 3. Dissemination & Learning  
Presented evaluation results at the **Union World Lung Conference**, **NASCOP** forums, and internal reflection sessions.  
Integrated findings into EDARP‚Äôs **annual strategic planning** and **program redesign** processes.

### 4. Collaboration & Review  
Worked with **external evaluators** to ensure methodological rigor, result validity, and utilization of findings in donor-funded program cycles.
