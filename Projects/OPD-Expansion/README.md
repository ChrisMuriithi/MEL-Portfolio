# OPD Expansion Project: Enhancing Access and Financial Sustainability Through Digital Transformation  

*Transforming EDARP‚Äôs service delivery through EMR integration, real-time analytics, and digital payment systems for sustainable outpatient care.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **EDARP Outpatient Department (OPD) Expansion Project** was implemented to strengthen **service delivery**, **financial sustainability**, and **patient experience** across 11 EDARP clinics.  

It transitioned EDARP from a **donor-dependent HIV/TB model** to an integrated outpatient care model ‚Äî offering general consultations, laboratory, and pharmacy services under the **Fikiria Jamii Health** brand.  

As the **M&E, ICT, and Systems Lead**, I designed the **data architecture**, **performance monitoring tools**, and **digital system integrations** that linked clinical, billing, and financial operations.  
This included integrating the **Carimed Insurance System** and **MPesa-linked payment reconciliation**, enhancing both patient convenience and real-time revenue visibility.

## üéØ Core Objectives
- Establish a **sustainable OPD service model** to reduce donor reliance  
- Integrate **EMR-based billing**, insurance, and service tracking modules  
- Improve **client flow**, turnaround time, and quality of care  
- Develop **real-time dashboards** for revenue, utilization, and service performance

Integrated **Carimed** for automated claim verification and **co-payment reconciliation** within Ecare.

### 3. Dashboard Development  
Built **Power BI dashboards** tracking daily revenue, consultation volumes, lab performance, and pharmacy sales.  
Created **DAX-based metrics** for monthly comparisons and variance analyses.

### 4. Process Automation  
Automated **daily data extraction** using SQL stored procedures with scheduled refreshes in Power BI.  
Linked **MPesa payment logs** with EMR transactions for instant receipting and reconciliation.

### 5. Performance Monitoring & Learning  
Implemented daily and weekly dashboard reviews with facility leads, tracking client flow, cash flow, and departmental performance.  
Used visual data feedback to guide facility-level operational improvements.

### 6. Data Protection & Compliance  
Integrated **informed consent workflows** within EMR billing modules and ensured adherence to **Kenya‚Äôs Data Protection Act (2019)**.
