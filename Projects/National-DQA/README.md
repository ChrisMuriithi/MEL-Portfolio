# National & Sub-National DQA Collaboration Project: Strengthening Data Governance and Standardization  

*Building a unified data quality culture through joint DQA exercises, standardized indicator definitions, and strengthened county-level accountability.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **National & Sub-National Data Quality Assurance (DQA) Collaboration Project** enhanced the integrity and consistency of health data through **joint DQA missions** between **EDARP**, **NASCOP/MOH**, and **County MEL Units** in **Murang‚Äôa**, **Kiambu**, and **Nairobi**.  

As the **DQA Technical Lead**, I represented EDARP in multi-county validation teams to cross-verify EMR data, paper registers, and DHIS2 reports.  
This collaborative effort advanced **data governance**, **indicator standardization**, and strengthened Kenya‚Äôs health information systems for more reliable decision-making.

## üéØ Core Objectives
- Validate **facility EMR-reported data** against source registers  
- Standardize **indicator definitions** and **DQA SOPs** across counties  
- Improve DQA follow-up through structured **action plans and feedback loops**  
- Strengthen **county-level ownership** of data governance through mentorship  

---

## üß∞ Languages & Utilities Used
| Tool / Platform | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|
| **SQL Server** | EMR data extraction and validation analysis |
| **Excel / Power Query** | DQA comparison templates, discrepancy summaries, and validation pivot tools |
| **DHIS2** | Verification of national indicator alignment and triangulated data reporting |
| **Power BI (Pilot)** | Visual DQA summaries for facility and county feedback sessions |

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment / Platforms
- **Ecare EMR** (facility data source)  
- **MOH DHIS2** (national reporting platform)  
- **Excel / Power BI** (data validation and feedback dashboards)  
- **Shared DQA Repository** via **SharePoint/Teams** for joint tool hosting

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Joint DQA Planning  
Collaborated with **NASCOP**, **CHMTs**, and implementing partners to define DQA objectives, indicators, and tools.  
Developed standardized DQA templates for **PMTCT**, **TX_CURR**, and **TB** programs.

### 2. Data Verification  
Cross-checked EMR data against paper registers and DHIS2 uploads to identify discrepancies, duplicates, or missing values.  
Validated indicator logic, denominators, and cross-site consistency.

### 3. Action Planning & Feedback  
Created structured **DQA action plans** and **follow-up trackers** to monitor implementation of corrective measures.  
Facilitated review meetings assigning accountability to site-level M&E focal persons.

### 4. Stakeholder Engagement  
Conducted debrief sessions with **County Health Management Teams (CHMTs)** and donor partners.  
Presented findings for inclusion in **county MEL strategic plans** and national DQA framework updates.

## üì¶ Key Outputs / Deliverables
- ‚úÖ **Standardized DQA Toolkits and SOPs** co-developed with NASCOP  
- ‚úÖ **County DQA Action Plans** and **Follow-Up Trackers**  
- ‚úÖ **DQA Dashboard** summarizing EMR‚Äìregister‚ÄìDHIS2 discrepancies  
- ‚úÖ **Validation Reports** and **Workshop Summaries** shared with CHMTs

## üìà Results & Impact
| Outcome | Result |
|----------|---------|
| **Standardization** | Unified indicator definitions across **3 counties** |
| **Corrective Action** | **95%** of DQA issues resolved within one quarter |
| **Governance** | Strengthened CHMT ownership of MEL and reporting processes |
| **Learning Influence** | DQA findings informed revisions of **national SOPs** and tools |

---

## üí° Lessons Learned & Next Steps
- **Data System Gaps:** Some EMR sites lacked real-time sync with DHIS2, requiring enhanced interoperability.  
- **Sustainability:** Recommend embedding DQA review dashboards into county MEL review cycles.  
- **Replication:** Expand DQA collaboration model to additional counties beyond Nairobi Cluster.
