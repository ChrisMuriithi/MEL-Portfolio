# Community-Based Health Information System (CBHIS) Project: Strengthening Community‚ÄìFacility Data Linkages through Digital Innovation  

*Digitally connecting community outreach with facility-level systems to enhance data visibility, accountability, and continuity of care.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **Community-Based Health Information System (CBHIS) Project** was designed to digitize community-level data collection and improve the flow of information between **Community Health Promoters (CHPs)** and health facilities within **Eastern Deanery AIDS Relief Program (EDARP)**.  

The project empowered CHPs to capture **real-time service delivery data** ‚Äî including HIV prevention, adherence follow-ups, and referrals ‚Äî directly into the **Ecare EMR system**, bridging a long-standing gap between outreach and facility-based care.  

As the **System Architect and M&E/ICT Lead**, I oversaw the system design, mobile application deployment, EMR integration, and dashboard analytics, ensuring compliance with Kenya‚Äôs **Data Protection Act (2019)** and alignment with national community health digitization strategies.

## üéØ Core Objectives
- Digitize community data collection using mobile tools integrated with EMR  
- Strengthen **community‚Äìfacility feedback loops** for client tracking and referrals  
- Improve **timeliness**, **accuracy**, and **visibility** of outreach data  
- Integrate **digital consent workflows** to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Act (2019)

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. System Design and Tool Development  
Conducted **co-design workshops** with CHPs and program teams.  
Developed digital forms covering HIV testing, PrEP refills, household mapping, and referrals.  
Embedded validation and skip logic to minimize data-entry errors.

### 2. Integration with EMR  
Configured **APIs** to synchronize referral and outreach data with **Ecare EMR**.  
Established **UPI-based record matching** to link community clients with facility records.

### 3. Data Pipeline Setup  
Developed **Python ETL pipelines** for weekly data extraction, cleaning, and SQL uploads.  
Configured **Power BI Gateway** for automatic refresh and visualization updates.

### 4. Monitoring & Dashboard Development  
Built **Power BI dashboards** tracking:  
- Referrals issued vs. completed  
- Household coverage by CHP  
- HIV testing and PrEP uptake by ward  
- Defaulter tracing and follow-up outcomes  
Added **alert systems** for missed follow-ups and low-performing CHPs.

### 5. Capacity Building and Supervision  
Trained **40 CHPs and 8 supervisors** on digital reporting, data protection, and consent protocols.  
Integrated **GPS tracking** for outreach coverage and performance supervision.

### 6. Data Protection & Compliance  
Introduced **digital consent forms**, **secure login protocols**, and **data audits** ensuring full **DPA 2019** compliance.

## üí° Lessons Learned & Future Improvements
- **Connectivity Gaps:** Introduced offline caching and delayed-sync mechanisms for low-connectivity areas.  
- **Device Management:** Budgeted for regular device maintenance and battery replacements.  
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Integrate **SMS reminders** for client follow-up  
  - Implement **AI anomaly detection** for referral tracking  
  - Link CBHIS data directly with **DHIS2 Community Module** for national reporting
