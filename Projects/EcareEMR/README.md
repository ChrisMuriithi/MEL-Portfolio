# Ecare EMR Integration Project: Strengthening Interoperability and Data Exchange in EDARP Health Systems  

*Connecting facility, community, and national systems to achieve seamless data exchange and continuity of care through standards-based interoperability.*

---

## üß© Project Overview
The **Ecare EMR Integration Project** was implemented to link **EDARP‚Äôs Electronic Medical Records (Ecare)** with Kenya‚Äôs **national and community health information systems** ‚Äî specifically **NiShauri**, **Ushauri**, and the **Community-Based Health Information System (CBHIS)**.  

The project addressed long-standing data fragmentation by establishing **real-time data exchange**, **automated ETL pipelines**, and **feedback loops** that ensured timely, accurate, and consistent data across facility, community, and national platforms.  

As the **System Integration Lead and M&E/ICT Manager**, I spearheaded the **system architecture**, **API development**, and **data validation frameworks**, ensuring compliance with **Kenya Health Data Interoperability Standards (KHIS)** and the **Data Protection Act (2019)**.

## üéØ Core Objectives
- Enable **bidirectional data sharing** between Ecare EMR and national/community platforms  
- Improve **timeliness**, **completeness**, and **accuracy** of patient-level data across 14 facilities  
- Support **continuity of care** through synchronized records between clinical and community systems  
- Enhance **visibility of HIV/TB and OPD indicators** for program management and donor reporting

## üß∞ Languages & Utilities Used
| Tool / Platform | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|
| **SQL Server** | Database management, data cleaning, and automated extract generation |
| **Python** | REST API scripting, ETL automation, and data transformation |
| **Postman** | API testing, payload validation, and debugging |
| **Power BI** | Visualization of interoperability metrics and system exchange rates |
| **Excel / Power Query** | Manual reconciliation and QA of exchange logs |
| **DHIS2 Data Exchange API** | Integration with national reporting pipelines |
| **Ecare EMR Modules** | Core, CBHIS, Pharmacy, Laboratory, Radiology, Procurement, HR |

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment / Platforms Used
- **Ecare EMR** (modular local deployment)  
- **Microsoft SQL Server** as backend data warehouse  
- **NiShauri & Ushauri APIs** (Ministry of Health communication platforms)  
- **CBHIS Android App** for field-level data collection and sync  
- **Power BI Service** for visualization and dashboard reporting  
- **VPN + SSL Encryption** for secure data exchange across all nodes

## üß≠ Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. System Mapping and Requirements Gathering  
Conducted comprehensive **data dictionary mapping** across EMR, CBHIS, and national systems.  
Aligned key identifiers (UPI, ART number, facility code) and defined standardized **JSON/XML exchange formats**.

### 2. API Integration Development  
Designed and configured **RESTful API endpoints** for bidirectional push/pull of client-level data between **Ecare**, **NiShauri**, and **Ushauri**.  
Implemented **OAuth 2.0 authentication**, **tokenized encryption**, and conflict-resolution logic for synchronization intervals.

### 3. Community Data Integration  
Linked **CBHIS** modules with EMR through cloud middleware to support **offline data capture** by Community Health Promoters (CHPs).  
Enabled automatic syncing upon internet connectivity restoration.

### 4. Automation and ETL Pipelines  
Developed **SQL and Python ETL jobs** automating daily data extraction, transformation, and load processes.  
Scheduled **Power BI refreshes** for real-time leadership dashboards.

### 5. Monitoring and Feedback Loops  
Deployed **Power BI dashboards** tracking synchronization volumes, error rates, and latency.  
Implemented **notification systems** for failed transfers, duplicate detection, and data integrity checks.

### 6. Compliance and Data Protection  
Embedded **informed consent** prompts in EMR workflows.  
Implemented **role-based access control**, **audit trails**, and **encryption at rest and in transit**, ensuring full **DPA 2019** compliance.
