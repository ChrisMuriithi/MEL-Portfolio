> This portfolio presents a compendium of Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) and Digital Health projects that I led and implemented. Each project exemplifies practical experience in data systems design, analytics automation, and digital transformation, underscoring how MEL can transcend conventional reporting to become a strategic driver of program improvement, financial sustainability, and adaptive learning through strengthened data systems, interoperable electronic medical records (EMRs), and evidence-driven dashboards.
