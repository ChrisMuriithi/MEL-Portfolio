# LINDA PIA DADA: Strengthening Digital HIV Prevention for AGYW in Nairobi  

![Project Banner](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/blob/main/PowerBI_Dashboard_Screenshots/cover.png?raw=true)  
*Empowering Adolescent Girls and Young Women (AGYW) through digital innovation, data-driven insights, and compassionate care.*

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
**LINDA PIA DADA** (*Swahili for “Protect My Sister”*) is a two-year, **ViiV Healthcare–funded** project implemented by **Eastern Deanery AIDS Relief Program (EDARP)**.  

It aims to enhance HIV prevention, care, and treatment outcomes among **Adolescent Girls and Young Women (AGYW)** in Nairobi’s eastern slums through **digital health transformation**, **community empowerment**, and **data analytics**.

As the **M&E and ICT Lead**, I designed the project’s digital monitoring and analytics framework — integrating EMR, mobile tools, and real-time dashboards while ensuring compliance with **Kenya’s Data Protection Act (2019)**.

---

## 🎯 Key Goals
- Increase demand for ARV-based HIV prevention (**PrEP/PEP**) services  
- Strengthen linkage and retention to care among AGYW  
- Improve data visibility using **mobile & EMR-based** reporting systems  
- Enhance community engagement through **digital and peer-led** interventions

| **Power BI** | Real-time dashboards (PrEP uptake, outreach coverage, adherence trends) |
| **Excel / Power Query** | Routine monitoring and indicator tracking |
| **KoboToolbox** | Mobile data collection by Community Health Promoters |
| **NVivo** | Qualitative coding and thematic analysis |
| **Ecare EMR** | Integrated clinical data and HIV care continuity |

## 🧭 Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Needs Assessment
Conducted a rapid data gap analysis across **14 facilities** to identify weaknesses in appointment adherence, PrEP linkage, and follow-up documentation.

### 2. Tool Design & Alignment
Developed data collection tools aligned with **ViiV** and **PEPFAR MER 2.8.2** indicators, integrating modules for outreach, digital engagement, and follow-up.

### 3. Data Pipeline Setup
Built an **SQL-based integration** pulling data from **Ecare EMR**, **KoboToolbox**, and **pharmacy logs**, with scheduled **ETL jobs** to clean and merge data weekly.

### 4. Dashboard Development
Created **Power BI dashboards** displaying AGYW reach, PrEP_NEW, adherence, and peer educator performance with **DAX-based** metrics for adherence and walk-ins.

### 5. Reporting & Learning
Automated generation of quarterly **Learning Briefs** and **visual summaries** used in review meetings and stakeholder feedback sessions.

### 6. Data Protection Integration
Embedded **informed consent** and **privacy protocols** across all digital tools, ensuring full compliance with **Kenya’s DPA 2019**.
